'''
Python Implementation of an algorithm to enable pagination in a messaging system
A user message can be longer than what can be sent at a time, hence splitting the message into smaller and efficient
chunks(160 characters or less) is necessary.
Some words like 'to'/'is' must be treated as a whole word when they appear as the last item in the chunk list and should not be splitted.
Otherwise if the last word in the list is for example 'possible' and the 160th character is at 'poss', the 'poss' will be in the first chunk
but the remaining 'ible' will be sent to the next chunk as the first item. when done we rejoin the two and create a chunk which shall
be pushed into our final intended array(list).

::OFTEN move the last word of the chunk to the next chunk since there is no guarantee it would be complete
